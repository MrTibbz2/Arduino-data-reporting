# Arduino-data-reporting
This project is to use an Arduino with sensors to communicate over 2.4ghz to an arduino to track data over time.
<h1>Week 1</h1>
This week we worked to allow our 2.4 ghz sensors to communicate, via arduino. One was programmed to send a signal, and the other was programmed to recieve the signal. We did this by first connecting the 2.4 ghz sensors to seperate arduino boards using the pins. We then coded the sensors, making one of them able to send a signal and the other to be able to recieve the signal. The codes we used were https://github.com/MrTibbz2/Arduino-data-reporting/edit/main/Rx.ino and https://github.com/MrTibbz2/Arduino-data-reporting/edit/main/tx.ino 
we also used these diagrams to figure out the wiring for the nrf24l01 modules at: https://github.com/MrTibbz2/Arduino-data-reporting/edit/main/diagram.jpg 
<h1>Week 2</h1>
This week we were able to setup and complete a serial based communications system between two NRF24s.
